## Typefaces

Serif vs Sans-serif

Serif

- Traditional / classif look and feel
- Conveys trustworthiness
- Good for long text

Sans-serif

- Modern look and feel
- Clean and simple
- Easier for beginner designer

<br />

Use good font sizes and weights

- Use up to 2 typefaces on each page.
- Use 16px to 32px for normal text
- For long text use a size of 20px or more
- For headlines you can use really big sizes like 50px+ and 600+ weight depending on personality
- Don't use a weight under 400
- Use less than 75 characters per line
- For normal text use a line height between 1.5 and 2 for big texts go below 1.5
- Decrease letter spacing in headlines if it seems unnatural
- Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small, bold, with increased letter spacing.
- Usually don't justify text
- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are okay.

## Choose the right color

- Red: Power, passion, excitment. Draws attention.
- Orange: Happy, cheerfulness, creativity. Less aggressive.
- Yellow: Joy, brightness, intelligence.
- Green: Harmony, nature, growth, health.
- Blue: Peace, trustworthiness, professionalism.
- Purple: Wealth, wisdom, magic.
- Pink: romance, care, affection.
- Brown: nature, durability, comfort.
- Black: power, elegance, minimalizm, grief and sorrow.

<br />

Use the main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
Use colors stratigically in images and illustrations.

Text usually should not be completely black. Lighten it up it looks heavy and uninviting.
Don't use very light texts that are hard to read.
